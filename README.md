Contract Address:  addr_test1wrdzsldt65nfpsy3e7gzfmfhstuwm3wjz5qxyt8e5jn0jegzlz7z2
txHash:  306f36a5332040da394a1652ef792b9214f92b60fc46e201a9f33d176a0d1245
```

node query_info.js
```

You will receive some information like this:

```sh
Contract Address:  addr_test1wrdzsldt65nfpsy3e7gzfmfhstuwm3wjz5qxyt8e5jn0jegzlz7z2
Single UTxO of Contract Address:  [
  {
    address: 'addr_test1wrdzsldt65nfpsy3e7gzfmfhstuwm3wjz5qxyt8e5jn0jegzlz7z2',
    tx_hash: '306f36a5332040da394a1652ef792b9214f92b60fc46e201a9f33d176a0d1245',
    tx_index: 0,
    output_index: 0,
    amount: [ [Object] ],
    block: '305fd7aea0b2eace2596bd9c2ab2a236bbb32d5fc42a9076a93d1401f78560e2',

    reference_script_hash: null
  }
]
Amount of this UTxO:  [ { unit: 'lovelace', quantity: '2000000' } ]
currentFund:  0
targetFund:  100
All transactions of Contract Address: ...
```

### 2.2. User contribute

```js
// Amount contribute to the crowdfunding
const amountContribute = 5n;
```

Run script:

```sh
node 2-user-contribute.js
```

You will get some output and the transaction hash:

If you try to change the currentFund in new datum to make it wrong like this (change currentFund to 100n):

```js
// Construct the datum
const datum = Data.to(
  new Constr(0, [previousAdminPKH, 100n, BigInt(previousTargetFund)])
);
console.log("datum: ", datum);
```

After running script, you will get the error message from contract:

```sh
Trace [Contract Error]: new current fund must be correct Trace Validator returned false
```
